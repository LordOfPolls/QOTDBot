# A Question of The Day bot with no bloat, just a lot of questions

QOTDBot uses Discord's **slash commands** to integrate into your server, which makes the bot significantly easier to use.

QOTDBot has no bloat, only commands for getting questions to you each day.  It also has a suggestion queue, so your members can suggest questions, and you can approve or reject them in your own time.
Each server has their own private suggestion pool, and everyday, each server gets a randomly selected question at a time you set. It even respects time zones

There are **no** features hidden behind a pay/vote wall, just use the bot and enjoy your questions

## How do I use this?

### Invite (recommended)
Click this link and the bot will be invited to your server with all the required permissions: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=805445862771654667&permissions=24640&scope=applications.commands%20bot

### Self host

I can't stop you from cloning this and hosting it yourself, hell i made it open source for a reason, however bare in mind that it requires a mysql database to store its data in. If you want to host it, feel free to make an issue and i'll walk you through what the DB needs

## Quickstart:

Once you've added the bot, type ``/setup simple`` in your server (where the bot can see and type)

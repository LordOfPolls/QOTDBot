## Can i use it?

I cant stop you hosting Query yourself, but i would advise against it. Query is dependent on a MYSQL database backend, and without that its completely useless. If youre heartset on hosting, make an issue and ill explain the database schema. 

For everyone else, heres an invite link. Do not modify this link, or take permissions/oauth scopes, they are the minimum requuirements: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=805445862771654667&permissions=24640&scope=applications.commands%20bot


## What is this?
Query is primarily a 'Question of The Day' bot, with a huge repository of default questions for you to use. Server admins can add ``custom questions`` to be asked in their servers, and members can suggest questions to a ``Suggestion Queue``, for server admins to approve or reject in their own time.

Query uses Discord's new ``slash commands`` to integrate into your server like never before, just type ``/`` and all the commands will appear, with auto-completion and options.

Query has no useless features, only questions. Commands include: ``'Question of the Day'``, ``polls``, and nothing else. Because you donâ€™t need another multi-purpose bot that does everything passably; you need a dedicated bot that does one thing great.

The polls have support to up to 20 options, manual and scheduled closing, bar charts, custom titles, and single vote enforcement. This makes it one of the more advanced poll bots.

There are ``no pay/votewalls`` stopping you from using the commands, just use the bot for questions, polls and have fun with it. No spam to be found! (Though upvotes are always appreciated).

Once you add Query, simply type ``/setup simple`` in your server and Query will walk you through the setup process.

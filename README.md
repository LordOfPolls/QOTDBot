Query is primarily a 'Question of The Day' bot, with a huge repository of default questions for you to use. Server admins can add ``custom questions`` to be asked in their servers, and members can suggest questions to a ``Suggestion Queue``, for server admins to approve or reject in their own time.

Query uses Discord's new ``slash commands`` to integrate into your server like never before, just type ``/`` and all the commands will appear, with auto-completion and options.

Query has no useless features, only questions. Commands include: ``'Question of the Day'``, ``polls``, and nothing else. Because you donâ€™t need another multi-purpose bot that does everything passibly; you need a dedicated bot that does one thing great.

There are ``no pay/votewalls`` stopping you from using the commands, just use the bot for questions, polls and have fun with it. No spam to be found! (Though upvotes are always appreciated).
